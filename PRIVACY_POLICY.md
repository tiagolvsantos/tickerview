# Privacy Policy for TickerView

**Last Updated: January 28, 2026**

TickerView ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in relation to the TickerView Chrome extension.

## 1. No Collection of Personal Information
TickerView **does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII)**. We do not require account creation, and we do not collect your name, email address, IP address, or location.

## 2. Browsing Data & Content
TickerView operates locally on your browser. 
- **Ticker Detection:** The extension scans the text of webpages you visit solely to identify stock tickers (e.g., $AAPL). This scanning happens entirely on your local machine.
- **Data Transmission:** When you hover over a detected ticker, the extension sends only that specific ticker symbol to Yahoo Finance APIs to retrieve market data. We do not send the URL of the page you are visiting or any other content from the page.

## 3. Data Storage
TickerView does not use any persistent storage. Statistical data and charts are held in the browser's temporary memory (cache) and are cleared when the browser is closed or the cache is flushed.

## 4. Third-Party Services
TickerView fetches financial data from Yahoo Finance. Your use of this extension is subject to Yahoo's privacy practices regarding their public APIs. We do not provide Yahoo with any information about you.

## 5. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
